<p>1985	-	The Music Centre produced Benjamin Britten's Noyes Fludde in St James Anglican Cathedral.<br> This involved hundreds of children and some of Townsville's best known (and loved) musicians. <br>It was produced by Rachel Berker (now Rachel Matthews) and involved Bernie Lannigan and Sandra Voss in the main parts rehearsed by Bill Williams; Donna McMahon and Jenny Carr rehearsing the strings and recorders and guest conductor Donald Hollier.<br> This was by the no means the only major production mounted by the Music Centre but was probably the largest.

<p>1987	-	This was the year of the first fund raising dinner.<br> These dinners became a tradition as they were a wonderful mixture of good food, good wine and good music. <br>The first ones were held at the home of Paul and June Tonnoir in North Ward. Later they moved to the Bishop's Lodge as guests of the Anglican Bishop. Attendees would often book their tickets for the next year's dinner as soon as they had attended this one.<br> They ran until 2004.
